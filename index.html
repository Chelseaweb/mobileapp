<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Chelsea Tatenda Mutizira,Born and Raised in England,UK. I have lived
 In Zimbabwe for two years and have been staying in South Africa ever since 2009.
 I am a respectful young lady who loves writing and dancing. I enjoy playing sports
 such as Netball. I take full interest in coding and politics hence why I pursued
 the Web Intensive Course at CodeSpace Academy. I attended Maitland High School from
 2015-2019.</p>
 I have strong values in respect, trust and honesty amongst people and believe
 it is the the key value to a successful business, partnership, and friendship .During my 
 free time, I focus on my online magazine 4Aiden, my script writing and dancing with my sister.
 In 2016, my sister and I decided to make a dance brand named Fifty1vlog where we showcase our love 
 for dance.We perform at local shows and upload our videos on the social media platforms Instagram and
 Facebook.My Career Goals is to expand my knowledge in web development and create an app of my own for
 my magazine. I also hope to also become recognized for my gift in writing and dancing.</p>
